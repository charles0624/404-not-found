Collaborative coding project for Foundations of Software Engineering @ Johns Hopkins University

## Skeletal Branch
The 'skeletal' branch contains all project work for the Group Project's skeletal increment.

```
## EXAMPLE FROM A TERMINAL
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:spaulso3/404-not-found.git

# check out skeletal branch
git checkout skeletal

# create a new branch and check it out
git checkout -b new_dev_feature

# add/modify files to implement features, then commit them
...
git add new_file.py
git commit -m "description of changes"
git push
```

When the new feature is complete, merge the feature branch onto the skeletal branch via the
"New pull request" button within github.
